# 🌌 Hi, welcome in
## 🎆 Here's a few things you can learn about me
* 💫 My name is Echo, I prefer to be referred to with she/her pronouns.
* 🚀 I'm a student at RVCC learning Webpage Design and Interactive Multimedia.
* 🛰️ My hobbies outside of school include tabletop, video and card games.
* 🛸 One day, I want to be able to make my own video games, being able to fund it off whatever money I make with a career in web design.
